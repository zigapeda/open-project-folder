# Open Project Folder

This extension adds the command "Open Project" to VS Code in order
to open a project folder located somewhere on your PC. Therefore
it scans defined directories called "Project Folders". Every
directory with folders and no files in it, is considered as project
folder again and is scanned for subdirectories. If a folder has
files, it is recognised as project and is added to the list for
opening.
